/** \brief Initializes all the light parameters for a particular instance of the structure depending on user input
 *
 * \param Pattern This variable holds one of the supported patterns
 * \param dir Specifies the direction in which the pattern will run
 * \param start Specifies the start time of the parameter
 * \param Cycle Specifies the number of times the pattern is supposed to run
 * \param Index Specifies the Index from which the pattern is suppose to start from
 * \param on This variable is Specifically used for only On_AND_OFF pattern. Specifies the time for which the LED's should be on.
 * \param off This variable is Specifically used for only On_AND_OFF pattern. Specifies the time for which the LED's should be off.
 * \param Brightness Used to set the brightness of the LED's.
 * \param color1 Used to set the color of the pattern(used by majority of the patterns).
 * \param color2 Used to set the 2nd color of the pattern(in this library only THEATER_CHASE uses this parameter).
 * \param Interval Used to set the time for which 1 cycle will run
 * \param g[] Stores the ID's of group of LED's in a pattern.
 * \param gLength Specifies the number of LED's that are part of a pattern.
 * \return void
